<h1 style="margin-bottom:0">Game 4: Humble Bee</h1>
</h1>
<p>"Humble Bee" is a simple, calming game about a bee. You work for the Queen Bee, and must go out and find pollen with your fellow bee friends. The more pollen you collect, the bigger and faster you become.</p>
<div style="text-align:center"><img src="flyingbee.jpg" width="640" height="640"/></div>
<p>The player can control the roll, pitch, and yaw of the bee, as well as the speed.</p>
<div style="text-align:center"><img src="rollbee.jpg" width="640" height="480"/></div>
<p>When the player finds a flower that has not been harvested, pollen is added to the player's total collection. Progression only takes place once the player has returned to the hive with more pollen.</p>

<h1 style="margin-bottom:0">Game 5: Salmon Run</h2>
</h1>
<p>"Salmon Run" is a 2D top-down sidescroller game in which the player is a salmon. The player's goal is to make it to the ocean.</p>
<div style="text-align:center"><img src="salmonrun.jpg" width="640" height="640"/></div>

<p>The game runs forever, so the player will never make it to the ocean, but the player should try to stay along for as long as possible. There will be obstacles in the water, and animals above and next to the water waiting for you to pass by. </p>
<div style="text-align:center"><img src="salmonget.jpg" width="480" height="480"/></div>
<p>What makes this sidescroller different is that the direction of the water can change at any time, and the orientation of the screen will not change with it.</p>

<h1 style="margin-bottom:0">Game 3: Jam Man</h1>
</h2>
<p>"Jam Man" is a game where the player makes music out of the controller. The game contains a variety of libraries, each with unique sounds. Each button on the controller is mapped to a sound within a library the player has chosen. To mirror the effect the player expects, the stage of the controller is mirrored on the game screen, and will visually change depending on the duration a button is pressed for.</p>
