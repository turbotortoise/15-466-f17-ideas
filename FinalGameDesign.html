<h1 style="margin-bottom:0">Game 1: Cheese Ball</h1>
</h1>
<p>"Cheese Ball" changes the way we look at cheese. We cut our cheese into cubes or rectangles, but the cheese would prefer to be in a different form: a sphere. This game features a cheese cube trying to become a cheese sphere. Help him accomplish his goal by deciding each movement. Each step the cube takes is another step closer to smoothness.</p>
<div style="text-align:center"><img src="sadcheese.jpg" width="320" height="240"/></div>
<p>The player will start by using WASD or the arrow keys to move each individual step. Each meter the cube takes will cause the cube to smooth out.</p>
<div style="text-align:center"><img src="fastcheese.jpg" width="320" height="240"/></div>
<p>Smoothing should be calculated by the Laplacian smoothing equation. When the ball is smooth enough, it will begin to roll on its own, but the player must still take control of the cube to prevent running into obstacles.</p>

<h1 style="margin-bottom:0">Game 2: Hammer Golf</h2>
</h1>
<p>"Hammer Golf" is a co-op game which battles players against each other in a more intense version of golf. Each player is given a hammer, and a heavy ball is placed in front of them. Each player must power up their hit by performing a sequence of button presses. The more successful presses a player has, the more power they have to hit the ball with.</p>

<p>The player who hits the ball the farthest wins. </p>

<h1 style="margin-bottom:0">Game 3: Amoeba</h1>
</h2>
<p>"Ameoba" is a take on Spore in which the player controls an amoeba. The amoeba is very hungry, and the player must guide the amoeba through the world. If the amoeba collides with food, the amoeba grows, while the scale of all other things throughout the world are decreased. If the amoeba collides with an enemy from the back, the enemy's scale is decreased. If the amoeba collides with an enemy from the front, the amoeba's scale is decreased, and the enemy's increases, making them more powerful.</p>

<p>Eventually, the ameoba will be gigantic in comparison to some life forms. If there are living cells that are less than 10% of the ameoba's scale are visible, but not interactable.</p>

<p>There is no end goal. However, the game ends when the ameoba has reached 50% of its maximum scale.</p>
